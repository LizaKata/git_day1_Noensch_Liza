Challenge | Merge conflict

In this exercise, your task is to deliberately create a merge conflict on a specific file and then resolve it. Unlike previous exercises, there are no assigned roles; you need to organize yourselves collaboratively to produce and resolve the conflict. It is important that you produce the merge conflict on a file and fix it keeping only one version of the file.

Remember, communication and collaboration are key during this exercise. Work together to resolve the conflict and ensure the final version of the file makes sense for your project.
